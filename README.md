## ‚ùÑÔ∏è overview

this is my personal fork of **arctictech**, an open-source csgo cheat base.
my goal is to fix existing bugs, modernize parts of the codebase, and make it easier for developers to build on top of it.
in addition to general fixes and optimizations, i'm focusing on improving the resolver, accuracy, animation system, and anything else i've encountered using it.
